            <p>Agriculture is an economy-based sector that involves a large amount of population. Harmful conditions like weather, pest attack, erratic rainfall and humidity affecting agricultural produce are common problems in India. Hence, it is imperative to get coverage as crop insurance for production and production-based losses. Crop insurance is the best way to decrease farmerâ€™s stress and to boost their welfare. Weather is the main problem for farmers that destroy the yield crop, so to protect from such types of issues like a flood, drought, thunder, fires etc., crop insurance is the best protection system for farmers.</p>
